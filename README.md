### Example

```bash
python calculator.py
```
## Operations

### Arithmetic
* Add: Adds two numbers.
* Subtract: Subtracts the second number from the first.
* Multiply: Multiplies two numbers.
* Divide: Divides the first number by the second (division by zero is handled).
* Power: Raises the first number to the power of the second.
* Nth Root: Computes the nth root of a number (handles negative numbers for odd roots only).

### Trigonometric
* Sine: Calculates the sine of an angle (in degrees).
* Cosine: Calculates the cosine of an angle (in degrees).
* Tangent: Calculates the tangent of an angle (in degrees).

### Logarithmic
* Logarithm: Computes the logarithm of a number with a specified base.

### Complex Numbers
* Complex Square Root: Calculates the square root of a complex number.

### Factorials
* Factorial: Computes the factorial of a non-negative integer.

### Statistics
* Mean: Calculates the mean of a set of numbers.
* Median: Computes the median of a set of numbers.
* Mode: Finds the mode of a set of numbers (handles non-unique mode).
* Standard Deviation: Computes the standard deviation of a set of numbers.

### Conversions
* To Binary: Converts a decimal number to its binary representation.
* From Binary: Converts a binary number to its decimal representation.

### Miscellaneous
* Calculate BMI: Computes the Body Mass Index based on weight and height.
* Exit: Exits the calculator program.
